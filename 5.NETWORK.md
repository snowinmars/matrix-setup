# Network

At this point you should have some docker containers, that provides communication services to users. It's time to hide these net from public.

Combine it with [PARTITIONS.md](4.PARTITIONS.md).

## Initial arch

1. You have a PC with linux
1. There are a docker compose file
1. The PC runs the docker images
1. There are a reverse proxy container that connect docker bridge network with public Internet
1. A user can access the apps from public Internet using reverse proxy

## Target arch

1. You have a PC with linux
1. There are a docker compose file
1. The PC runs the docker images
1. There are a reverse proxy container that connect docker bridge network with public Internet
1. There are a **dns server** inside the network that resolves domain, so you **don't need to buy a domain**
1. There are a reverse proxy that connect docker bridge network with **wireguard server**
1. There are **a i2p-over-vpn tunnel**
1. So a user can access the apps from public Internet using i2p vpn tunneling

## Add wireguard container

1. Here and below you will use files inside some directory `.` The result tree will look something like:

```
.
├── ngx/
├── ...
├── wireguard/
│   └── Dockerfile
└── docker-compose.yaml
```

To generate this tree, use the following commands:

- `mkdir ./wireguard`
- `touch ./wireguard/Dockerfile` 

2. Add to `./wireguard/Dockerfile`
```dockerfile
# ./wireguard/Dockerfile
FROM lscr.io/linuxserver/wireguard:1.0.20210914
```

3. Add to `./docker-compose.yaml`
```dockerfile
# ./docker-compose.yaml
...
  wireguard:
    container_name: wireguard
    image: snowinmars/wireguard:1.0.0
    hostname: wireguard
    build:
      context: ./wireguard
      dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
    depends_on:
      # pick a service with healthcheck
        condition: service_healthy
    # restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 51820:51820/udp
    volumes:
      - ./wireguard:/config
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
      - SYS_MODULE
    sysctls:
      - net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
      - SERVERURL=localhost
      - SERVERPORT=51820
      - PEERS=1 # set to how many clients you will have on the vpn server
      - PEERDNS=auto
      - INTERNAL_SUBNET=10.13.13.0
      - ALLOWEDIPS=0.0.0.0/0
      - PERSISTENTKEEPALIVE_PEERS=all
      - LOG_CONFS=false
    # healthcheck:
      # test: ["CMD-SHELL", "wget -O /dev/null http://localhost || exit 1"]
      interval: 60s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 2
      start_period: 10s
      start_interval: 5s
```

4. Change ngx host name to something that you like. You can choose almost any host name - you are the god)

```
# ./docker-compose.yaml
...
  matrix-ngx:
    ...
    hostname: any.host.ru
```

5. Regenerate letsencrypt certs using new hostname

6. Ensure you have wireguard port (51820) open

7. Vpn up: `sudo wg-quick up ./wireguard/peer1/peer1.conf`

8. You should be able to ping your new hostname (be patient, in my case ping responds after 20 sec or kinda). If you can - vpn+dns works. But there's an issue: vpn consumes all the traffic. So you should est it up properly:

## Panic

`cryptsetup erase`

1. Think about panic signal. The `/dev/sdXY` partiotion now has the header and the encrypted data. The header contains encryption key, this key and the passphrase you have is required for any operation. You can't be sure that the passphrase won't leak, so there should be a way to destroy the header and to rewrite this sectors several times. It will make all the data unavaiable, and you will be no longer forced to protect the passphrase. See [#Panic] section, but you can skip it for now.
