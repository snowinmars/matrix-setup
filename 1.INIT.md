# INIT

    Almost all containers will restrict you to read or write to it's config files
    due to these containers work under another user. So run your IDE using sudo.

    Some containers allow to setup them to work under `docker` group.
    If it's possible - try to do it: you are in the docker group too.
    Working under sudo is not a best way,
    but sometimes it's the only convinient way you have.

## Domain

I'll reference to the domain `example.com` as `$NGX_DOMAIN`

- If you run the system locally...
  - ...to test, ignore security: `$NGX_DOMAIN` is `localhost`
  - ...to run in production, you'll provide domain yourself:  `$NGX_DOMAIN` can be ANYTHING you like
- If you run the system in cloud - buy a domain. In this flow `$NGX_DOMAIN` should follow your provider rules
  1. Register domain `$NGX_DOMAIN`
  1. Create a virtual machine with public ip
  1. Add DNS 'A/AAAA' record:

    `$NGX_DOMAIN -> public ip`

## Server Setup

### Linux

Just use linux. Pick any you want, I'll use arch as an example in this guide.

### User

1. `adduser <USERNAME>` - or use youself
1. Add user to sudoers `sudo adduser <USERNAME> sudo`
1. Add user to docker group (after docker installation) `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
1. Login as the new user

### Ssh

    Beware: if you misconfigurate something, you'll loose access to the target PC, if you are not physically near it. So do this step before any other and try not to touch it again.

`sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`

1. Change SSH Port to something from `30000` to `50000`

   This is security though obsucurity which is not ideal but port `22` just gets abused by bots.
1. Disable ssh by password
1. Setup SSH Keys **with** passphrase
1. Restart SSH: `sudo systemctl restart sshd`
1. Optional: install and run `fail2ban`

### Port forwarding

    Beware: if you misconfigurate something, you'll loose access to the target PC, if you are not physically near it. So do this step before any other and try not to touch it again.

You must be able to open some ports. Learn how to do that using port 51820 as an example.

1. Install `ufw`
1. `sudo ufw allow 51820/tcp`
1. `sudo ufw allow 51820/udp`
1. `sudo ufw enable`

Now you'll execute commands in pair.

- in one terminal: `nc -lp 51820`
- in other terminal make sure this port has LISTEN state:
  - `sudo iptables -L` - should contain 51820 tcp/udp in and out
  - `sudo netstat -tulpn` - should contain 51820 tcp/udp in and out
  - `sudo ufw status` - should contain 51820 tcp/udp in and out
  - `sudo ufw listening` - should contain tcp listener

- in one terminal: `nc -lup 51820`
  - `sudo ufw listening` - should contain udp listener

If it does, you open the port on PC. The next step is to check access from your local network.

- `ifconfig` - find your adapter and pick your local address, f.e. `192.168.0.101`
- open your router settings and forward the port 51820 to 192.168.0.101:51820
- in one terminal: `nc -lp 51820`
- on other terminal: `telnet 192.168.0.101 51820` - you should be able to write something in this terminal and press Enter - the string should be passed into the listener terminal

If it does, you open the port from your PC to your local network.

Continue to repeat these steps, using higher and higher routers, finishing with your public ip:

- find your public ip, f.e. 215.201.5.110
- in one terminal: `nc -lp 51820`
- on other terminal: `telnet 215.201.5.110 51820`

If it still works, you are fine to go. You can double check that port is open using an online port checker.

If it does not work - fix it. You'll need port forwarding anyway.

### Partition

If you want to build a production server - create a partition and use it. It will be safer, if you'll buy a small drive and run experiments on it, not on your host machine.

### Install Docker and Docker Compose

Install the NEWEST docker compose.

### Nginx

1. Here and below you will use files inside some directory `.` The result tree will look something like:

```
.
├── crt/
│   └── letsencrypt/
├── ngx/
│   ├── acme-challenge/
│   ├── cors.conf
│   ├── default.conf
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── https.conf
└── docker-compose.yaml
```

To generate this tree, use the following commands:

- `mkdir -p ./crt/letsencrypt/ ./ngx/acme-challenge`
- `touch ./docker-compose.yaml ./ngx/default.conf ./ngx/cors.conf ./ngx/https.conf ./ngx/Dockerfile`


2. Setup `./ngx/Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
# ./ngx/Dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine AS build

RUN mkdir -p /var/log/nginx/logs
RUN mkdir -p /var/www/html/acme-challenge
RUN mkdir -p /etc/letsencrypt
RUN mkdir -p /var/www/certbot
RUN rm /etc/nginx/conf.d/*

EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 443

CMD [ "nginx", "-g", "daemon off;" ]
```

3. Create `./ngx/default.conf`:

```nginx
# ./ngx/default.conf
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name $NGX_DOMAIN;

    location ^~ /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        allow all;
        default_type "text/plain";
        alias /var/www/html/acme-challenge/;
        break;
    }

    return 200 'hello'; # beware: this line will override acme challenge flow. Drop it, if you need to test acme
}
```

4. Create docker compose with ngx:

```yaml
# ./docker-compose.yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  matrix-ngx:
    container_name: matrix-ngx
    image: snowinmars/matrix-ngx:1.0.0
    hostname: $NGX_DOMAIN
    # restart: unless-stopped
    build:
      context: ./ngx
      dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
    ports:
      - '80:80'
      - '443:443'
    volumes:
      - ./ngx/default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
      - ./ngx/https.conf:/etc/nginx/https.conf
      - ./ngx/cors.conf:/etc/nginx/cors.conf
      - ./ngx/acme-challenge:/var/www/html/acme-challenge
      - ./crt/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "wget -O /dev/null http://localhost || exit 1"]
      interval: 60s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 2
      start_period: 10s
      start_interval: 5s

networks:
  default:
    driver: bridge
```

5. Run `docker compose up` and check that `http://$NGX_DOMAIN` returns 'hello'.

### Ssl

In this step you can use any certbot flow you know. The point is to get ssl files. I'll use manual flow.

1. Install and run `certbot` to any pc, it does not have to be your production host. Run `sudo certbot certonly --manual` for `$NGX_DOMAIN`.

    You may want to create additional setrificates for `*.$NGX_DOMAIN`. You may want to create just `$NGX_DOMAIN`

    If you want to clear previous certificates, use `sudo certbot delete`

2. Ask `certbot` to generate certificates for `$NGX_DOMAIN`. It will produce acme files and/or DNS TXT records

3. Add acme files to `./ngx/acme-challenge` directory and/or add DNS TXT records to DNS server and follow the rest certbot steps

4. Check that new certificates appears on PC (see certbot console output, default folder is `/etc/letsencrypt/live/$NGX_DOMAIN`)

5. Check that certificates is valid using `sudo openssl x509 -enddate -noout -in /etc/letsencrypt/live/$NGX_DOMAIN/fullchain.pem`

6. Copy all new certificates from `/etc/letsencrypt/` to `./crt/letsencrypt` directory. It should looks like

```
.
└── crt/
    └── letsencrypt/
        ├── accounts/
        └── ...
```

7. Replace `./ngx/https.conf` with the following:
```nginx
# ./ngx/https.conf
ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/$NGX_DOMAIN/fullchain.pem;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/$NGX_DOMAIN/privkey.pem;
ssl_session_timeout 1h;
ssl_session_cache shared:MozSSL:10m;  # about 40000 sessions
ssl_session_tickets off;
ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers off;

proxy_pass_header Server;
proxy_set_header  Host            $http_host;
proxy_set_header  X-Real-IP       $remote_addr;
proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

# OCSP stapling
ssl_stapling on;
ssl_stapling_verify on;

# HSTS (ngx_http_headers_module is required) (63072000 seconds)
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000" always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options    "nosniff";
add_header Referrer-Policy           "strict-origin-when-cross-origin";
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains;";
add_header Permissions-Policy "accelerometer=(), camera=(), geolocation=(), gyroscope=(), magnetometer=(), microphone=(), payment=(), usb=(), interest-cohort=()";
add_header X-Frame-Options           "SAMEORIGIN";
add_header X-XSS-Protection           1;
add_header X-Robots-Tag               none;
```

8. Replace `./ngx/cors.conf` with the following:
```nginx
# ./ngx/cors.conf
if ($request_method = 'OPTIONS') {
  # Custom headers and headers various browsers *should* be OK with but aren't
  # add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'DNT,User-Agent,X-Requested-With,If-Modified-Since,Cache-Control,Content-Type,Range';

  add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'    '*';
  add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods'   'GET, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS, PUT';
  add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers'   '*';
  add_header 'Access-Control-Max-Age'         1728000; # 20 days
  add_header 'Content-Type'                   'text/plain; charset=utf-8';
  add_header 'Content-Length'                 0;

  return 204;
}
```

9. Replace `./ngx/default.conf` with the following:
```nginx
# ./ngx/default.conf
server {
    listen 80;
   
    server_name $NGX_DOMAIN;

    location ^~ /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        allow all;
        default_type "text/plain";
        alias /var/www/html/acme-challenge/;
        break;
    }

    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    listen [::]:443 ssl;

    http2 on;
    server_name matrix-ngx;

    include /etc/nginx/https.conf;

    location ^~ /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        allow all;
        default_type "text/plain";
        alias /var/www/html/acme-challenge/;
        break;
    }

    return 200 'hello'; # beware: this line will override acme challenge flow. Drop it, if you need to test acme
}
```

10. Run `docker compose up` and check that `http://$NGX_DOMAIN` redirects to https and returns 'hello'.
