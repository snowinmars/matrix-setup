# Partitions

At this point you should have some docker containers, that provides communication services to users. It's time to hide the storage data.

Combine it with [NETWORK.md](5.NETWORK.md).

    In this guide use the following substitution:
    - $USERNAME: snowinmars
    - $NAME:     any_string

## Initial arch

1. You have a PC with linux
1. There are a docker compose file
1. The PC runs the docker images
1. There are a reverse proxy container that connect docker bridge network with public Internet
1. A user can access the apps from public Internet using reverse proxy

## Target arch

1. You have a PC with linux **in your flat**
1. You have **a separate volume**
1. The volume is **encrypted** and NOT automounted
1. There are a docker compose file **on the volume**
1. The PC runs docker images
1. A user can access the apps from public Internet using reverse proxy

## Create a separate volume

Try to avoid system and application mixing. Just buy and external drive.

1. Pick a device `/dev/sdX`
1. Create a new partition `/dev/sdXY` on the device. You can use the device `/dev/sdX` itself, it doesn't matter, until there's only one partition on the disk

### dm-crypt

Run dm-crypt on `/dev/sdXY`: see [textguide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt) and [videoguide](https://youtu.be/Lc5BV3P5kjc)

    Do not use any automatization or kinda. Be sure that if you plug your PC out of electricity, it will NOT restore back without your will

Main steps from guides above:

1. `sudo cryptsetup --verbose --cipher aes-xts-plain64 --key-size 512 --iter-time=4000 --hash sha512 luksFormat /dev/sdX`
1. `lsblk`
1. `sudo cryptsetup open --type luks /dev/sdX $NAME`
1. `lsblk` - the device changed
1. `sudo cryptsetup -v status $NAME`
1. `sudo cryptsetup open --type plain -d /dev/urandom /dev/sdXY $NAME`
1. `sudo cryptsetup close $NAME`

### zfs

Run zfs on top of dm-crypt on `/dev/sdXY`: see [guide](https://github.com/danboid/creating-ZFS-disks-under-Linux) and [another guide](https://gist.github.com/kdwinter/2e779abab2e25f8a0bdea7928860fbb5).

    Do not use any automatization or kinda. Be sure that if you plug your PC out of electricity, it will NOT restore back without your will

Main steps from guides above:

1. `sudo zpool create -o ashift=12 -m none -R /mnt $NAME /dev/mapper/$NAME`
1. `sudo zfs set mountpoint=/path/to/dir $NAME`
1. `sudo zpool export $NAME` to unmount
1. `sudo zpool import $NAME` to mount
1. `sudo chown -R $USER:users /home/homk/prg/$USER$NAME/$NAME`

### dm-crypt + zfs

So, full device flow is:

1. `sudo zpool status` - check status of zfs
1. `sudo cryptsetup open /dev/sdX $NAME` - open ("mount") dm-crypt device
1. `sudo zpool import $NAME` - import ("mount") zfs
1. ...work...
1. `sudo zpool export $NAME` - export ("umount") zfs
1. `sudo cryptsetup close $NAME` - close ("umount") dm-crypt device

**Do test** what happens if you hot unplug the device. Learn how to restore. Usefull commands:

1. `ls /dev/mapper` - list all dm-crypt devices
1. `lsblk` - check status of mounted dm-crypt devices
1. `sudo cryptsetup -v status $NAME` - check status of dm-crypt
1. `sudo dmsetup info $NAME` - info about $NAME
1. `sudo lsof | grep $NAME` - who uses $NAME
1. `sudo fuser /dev/mapper/$NAME` - who uses $NAME

## Restore the apps

1. Open encrypted folder `.`
1. Restore all the docker apps, that you had before on the encrypted disk. Make sure it work before processing further
1. Reboot the system and make sure that docker apps won't run by themselves
